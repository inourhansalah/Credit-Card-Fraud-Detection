# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning. Due to the imbalanced nature of fraud datasets, multiple resampling techniques such as **SMOTE**, **Random UnderSampling (RUS)**, and **Random OverSampling (ROS)** were applied to improve model performance.
